## Your docs have a new audience

Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, Codex, Gemini CLI; millions of developers use AI coding agents that read your documentation in real time. When an agent can't read your docs, it falls back on training data or other sources, and developers get bad answers. You won't get bug reports about it. The developer blames the agent, or your product, and moves on. Or the agent recommends a different product it can understand and use better, and developers never discover your product at all.

Many documentation sites have problems agents can't work around: client-side rendering that delivers empty shells, pages so bloated with CSS and JavaScript that content gets truncated, no discovery path to clean markdown versions. These are invisible to human readers but dealbreakers for agents.

The good news: most fixes are configuration changes, not content rewrites. Adding an `llms.txt`, enabling server-side rendering, or serving `.md` URLs can move a site from an F to a B in a single sprint. [Read the full business case →](/why-agent-friendliness-matters)
